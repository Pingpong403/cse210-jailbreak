# Jailbreak

> *"Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me."*
> - George Costanza, *Seinfeld*

**For this frog, it's life or death. He's not looking for the high score but freedom.**

*Why was he in jail in the first place? No one knows. Does he deserve to leave? Maybe...*


#### **That all depends on how well _you_ play**

## Objective
To get past all the crazy, cop-filled roads and over the swift streams to safety! What's waiting for you in level 4 has yet to be discovered.

## Controls
**Up**, **down**, **left**, and **right** arrow keys to move.
**Enter** to start the game.

## Rules
* You cannot move off-screen, except for the top. That's where the lext level is.
* Cars and tricycles, no matter how slow they are, kill you!
* Although you play as a frog, he can't swim. He must've forgotten how to in jail.
* Logs are safe to jump on and protect you from drowning.
* DISCLAIMER: level 4 is cool, but trying to exit it will crash the game! Lose all your lives to the tricycles to start over at level 1.

*Fun fact: the "tricycles" are a real mode of transportation in the Philippines and other places in Southeast Asia. They consist of a motorcycle with a sidecar attached. They might be small, but you can fit up to 8 people in there!*
